<p>This is an example of an uncommon HTML bug.  It involves nested inline elements that unexpectedly collapse or render incorrectly due to the browser's handling of inline and inline-block elements.  Consider this code:</p><pre><code>&lt;span style="display: inline-block; width: 100px; background-color: lightblue;"> &lt;span style="display: inline; width: 50px; background-color: lightgreen;">Inner Span&lt;/span>&lt;/span></code></pre><p>While one might expect the green inner span to take up only 50px of the width, and the blue outer span to be 100px wide, the inner inline span's width may be ignored, causing the outer span to collapse to fit only the content of the inner span (50px). This is due to the interaction of inline and inline-block elements, and can be very hard to debug.</p>
